## Introduction
Lovelace card designed specifically for the [ABlink
Integration](https://github.com/scandara/hass-blink).

<a name="introduction-features"></a>
#### Features
It provides:
* Motion and sound notifications.
* Access to the camera library recordings.
* Live streaming.
* Support for doorbell and door opening notifications.
* Support for toggling lights during streaming.

<a name="introduction-notes"></a>
#### Notes
This document assumes you are familiar with Home Assistant setup and configuration.

<a name="introduction-thanks"></a>
#### Thanks
Many thanks to:
* [Button Card](https://github.com/kuuji/button-card/blob/master/button-card.js)
  for a working lovelace card I could understand
* [JetBrains](https://www.jetbrains.com/?from=hass-blink) for the excellent
  **PyCharm IDE** and providing me with an open source license to speed up the
  project development.

## Installation

<a name="installation-hacs"></a>
#### HACS
[![hacs_badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/HACS-Default-orange.svg?style=for-the-badge)](https://github.com/custom-components/hacs)

Blink is part of the default HACS store. If you're not interested in development
branches this is the easiest way to install.  See [hass-blink-hacs](hacsinstall.md) for some hints on installing and setup using HACS and the home assistant interface.

<a name="installation-from-script"></a>
#### From Script

```sh
install /config
# check output looks good
install go /config
```

Add the following to the top of your UI configuration file.

```yaml
resources:
  - type: module
    url: /local/blink-glance.js
```

The card type is `blink-glance.js`.

### `entity` vs `camera`
You only need one of these. `entity` is the full camera entity id - for
example, `camera.blink_front_door` while `camera` is just the name portion -
for example, `blink_front_door`.

### Naming
If you don't change entity names you don't need to worry about this.

The code tries to be smart about mapping cameras to device names and as long as
you follow certain rules the card can automatically generate device names.

Given the entity id `camera.blink_front_door`, you get a `prefix` of "blink_"
and a `camera_name` of "front_door".

Given the entity id `camera.front_door`, you get a `prefix` of "" and a
`camera_name` of "front_door".

The device names are calculated as:
* motion device = `binary_sensor.${prefix}motion_${camera_name}`
* sound device = `binary_sensor.${prefix}sound_${camera_name}`
* battery device = `sensor.${prefix}battery_level_${camera_name}`
* signal_device = `sensor.${prefix}signal_strength_${camera_name}`
* capture_today_device = `sensor.${prefix}captured_today_${camera_name}`
* last_capture_device = `sensor.${prefix}last_${camera_name}`

If you rename any of the `blink` using a different scheme you will need to
provide the full device name to get motion, sound, battery, signal, capture or
last capture notifications to work. See the corresponding `*_id` configuration
item.


### `show` options
* `motion`: an icon that indicates when motion is detected
* `sound`: an icon that indicates when sound is detected
* `battery_level`: an icon that shows current battery level
* `signal_strength`: an icon that shows wifi signal strength
* `snapshot`: an icon that takes a snapshot when pressed
* `captured_today`: an icon with descriptive text showing how many recordings
  have been captured today.
* `image_date`: an icon with descriptive text showing when the last image was
  taken
* `on_off`: a switch allowing the camera to be turned off and on

#### Notes
To get the first four `show` items to work correctly you need to enable the
corresponding `binary_sensor` or `sensor`. For example, to get motion
notifications working you need the following binary sensor enabled:

```yaml
binary_sensor:
  - platform: blink
    monitored_conditions:
    - motion
```



#### Example

The following is my front door camera configuration.

```yaml
type: 'custom:blink-glance'
entity: camera.blink_front_door_camera
name: Front Door
show:
  - motion
  - sound
  - snapshot
  - battery_level
  - signal_strength
  - captured_today
  - image_date
top_title: false
top_status: false
top_date: false
image_click: play
door: binary_switch.front_door
door_lock: lock.front_door_lock
door_bell: binary_switch.blink_ding_front_door_bell
door2: binary_switch.front_door
door2_lock: lock.front_door_lock
door2_bell: binary_switch.blink_ding_front_door_bell
light: light.blink_front_light
```

You don't need to reboot to see the GUI changes, a reload is sufficient. And if
all goes will see a card that looks like this:


<a name="how-it-looks"></a>
## How it looks
![Blink Glance](https://github.com/scandara/hass-blink/blob/master/images/blink-glance-02.png)

Reading from left to right you have the camera name, motion detection indicator,
captured clip indicator, battery levels, signal level and current state. If you
click the image the last captured clip will play, if you click the last captured
icon you will be show the video library thumbnails - see below. Clicking the
camera icon (not shown) will take a snapshot and replace the current thumbnail.
(See supported features for list of camera statuses)

Clicking on the last captured clip will display thumbnail mode. Clicking on a
thumbnail starts the appropiate video.  You can currently only see the last 99
videos. If you move your mouse over a thumbnail it will show you time of capture
and, if you have a Smart subscription, a reason for the capture. **>** takes you
to the next page, **<** to the previous and **X** closes the window.
